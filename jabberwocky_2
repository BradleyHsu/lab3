2 All mimsy were the borogoves,
25 â€œAnd hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
17 Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
15 And, as in uffish thought he stood,
13    And stood awhile in thought.
3    And the mome raths outgrabe.
33    And the mome raths outgrabe.
6    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
